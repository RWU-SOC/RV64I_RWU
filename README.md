# RV64 Core — RISC-V 64-bit Processor Core Implementation

This repository contains the initial materials for a RISC-V 64-bit processor core implementation and its specification documentation.

The formal implementation specification is written with Sphinx and lives in the `docs/` directory. It covers architecture, design elements, memory maps, testing and verification, and electrical characteristics.

Important links

- Sphinx source: `docs/source/`
- Built HTML (local): `docs/build/html/index.html` (generated by the CI or by running the local build commands below)
- Built LaTeX output (local): `docs/build/latex/` (contains the generated .tex and, after building, the PDF `RV64_Specification.pdf`)

Quick overview

- Project: RV64 Core — a single-cycle RISC-V 64-bit processor core implementation (RV64IMAC)
- Author / Affiliation: Mohamed — Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten (System on a Chip)
- Revision: 1.0 (document date: November 5, 2025)

Key features (summary)

- ISA: RV64I
- Single-cycle architecture (CPI ≈ 1.0)
- 64-bit datapath, 32 × 64-bit general-purpose registers
- CSR and exception/interrupt support, PMP regions
- Wishbone bus (I/D) interfaces, JTAG debug module
- Deliverables planned: synthesizable RTL (VHDL/SystemVerilog), testbenches, verification environment, and documentation

Build the documentation locally

1. Install Python dependencies (recommended in a virtualenv):

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

2. Build HTML output to `docs/build/html`:

```powershell
sphinx-build -b html -j auto docs/source docs/build/html
```

3. Build LaTeX sources for PDF:

```powershell
sphinx-build -b latex docs/source docs/build/latex
```

4. Create the PDF (using `latexmk` or your TeX toolchain):

On Windows (if `latexmk` available in PATH):

```powershell
cd docs\build\latex
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error
```
